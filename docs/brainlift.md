# 🧠 Brainlift Log – SuperHead Showdown

## 📅 Day 1 — Phase 1: Project Setup & Multiplayer Foundation

---

### 🎯 Objective

Set up the full development environment for the game, including:
- Phaser 3 frontend
- Node.js + Socket.io server
- Connecting both sides via real-time sockets

---

### ✅ Accomplished

#### 🖥️ Frontend Setup
- Created `/client` folder with:
  - `index.html` (Phaser canvas)
  - `style.css` (basic UI styling)
  - `game.js` (Phaser game logic)
- Implemented:
  - 800x600 canvas
  - Gravity + physics-based player movement
  - Arrow key / WASD controls
  - FPS counter
  - Visual styling (dark blue background, green square player)
  - Socket connection status + player ID rendering

#### 🛠 Backend Setup
- Created `/server` folder with:
  - `server.js` (Express + Socket.io)
  - `package.json`
- Configured:
  - Socket.io connection logging
  - Ping route (`/ping`) for health check
  - JSON response for server status

#### 🌐 Client-Server Connection
- Client connects to `localhost:3000`
- Sends `"hello from client"` and receives `"hello from server"`
- Verified connection with:
  - Console logs
  - On-screen socket ID + success messages
- Tested in multiple browser tabs to confirm unique player sockets

### 🧩 Challenges & AI Assistance

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Understanding why the game wasn't loading at localhost:3000 | Realized that was the backend server; frontend is served separately |
| Connecting Socket.io client-side with the correct library | Used Cursor to guide setup with CDN and confirm connection logic |
| Managing folder structure cleanly | AI prompt clarified desired structure for `/client` and `/server` |

### 🔧 Technical Decisions

#### Frontend Framework Choice
- **Decision**: Phaser 3 with vanilla JavaScript
- **Reasoning**: Lightweight, well-documented, perfect for 2D games
- **AI Input**: Helped structure the game loop and physics setup

#### Backend Architecture
- **Decision**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io
- **Reasoning**: Real-time multiplayer requires WebSocket connections
- **AI Input**: Guided proper Socket.io event handling and player management

#### Development Setup
- **Decision**: Separate client/server folders with independent serving
- **Reasoning**: Clean separation of concerns, easier deployment later
- **AI Input**: Clarified the difference between serving static files vs API endpoints

### 🎮 Current Game State

**What Works:**
- ✅ Basic Phaser 3 game with player movement
- ✅ Real-time Socket.io connection
- ✅ Visual connection status indicators
- ✅ Multiple player support (unique IDs)

**What's Next (Phase 2):**
- 🔄 Synchronize player positions across clients
- 🔄 Add soccer ball physics
- 🔄 Implement goal detection
- 🔄 Add basic match mechanics

---

### 📊 Learning Metrics

**Time Spent**: ~2 hours  
**AI Prompts Used**: 3 major prompts + clarifications  
**Technologies Learned**: 
- Phaser 3 game initialization
- Socket.io client-server communication
- Real-time event handling

**Key Takeaways**:
1. AI excels at boilerplate setup and structure guidance
2. Testing connections early prevents later debugging headaches
3. Visual feedback (connection status) helps verify functionality

---

### 🚀 Next Session Goals

1. **Phase 2 Start**: Implement basic multiplayer gameplay
2. **Player Sync**: Share player positions between clients
3. **Game Objects**: Add soccer ball and goal posts
4. **Match Logic**: Basic scoring system
