## 📅 Day 2 — Phase 2: Core Game Loop (Single Player)

---

### 🎯 Objective

Build the foundational soccer gameplay loop using Phaser 3:
- Ball physics and interactions
- Goal scoring logic
- Scoreboard and win condition
- Match timer

---

### ✅ Section 2.1 — Ball Mechanics

#### Tasks Completed:
- Added soccer ball to the scene with:
  - Gravity enabled
  - Bounce and collision with player and world bounds
- Ball spawns at center of screen
- Placeholder sprite used for now

#### AI Prompt:
```text
Let's begin Phase 2: Core Game Loop (Single Player). Start with Section 2.1...
```

---

### ✅ Section 2.2 — Goals, Score, Win Condition

#### Tasks Completed:
- Created invisible left/right goal zones
- Ball resets and score increases on overlap
- Score displayed at top of screen using Phaser text
- Win condition: First to 3 goals
- Game ends and displays win message
- Ball and player movement freeze

#### AI Prompt:
```text
Let's continue Phase 2 and move to Section 2.2: Goals, Score, and Win Condition...
```

---

### ✅ Section 2.3 — Match Timer

#### Tasks Completed:
- 60-second countdown timer added
- Timer updates every second
- Game ends if timer reaches 0 before goal limit
- Displays "Time's Up!" message
- All movement and game activity stop on match end

#### AI Prompt:
```text
Let's complete Phase 2 with Section 2.3: Add a match timer...
```

---

### 🧠 Notes & Learnings

- Using `this.time.addEvent()` was effective for countdown loops
- Handling both time-based and score-based game endings requires clear conditional logic
- Phaser's overlap is useful for goal detection zones
- Placeholder assets keep dev fast — we'll add visuals later

---

## 📅 Day 3 — Phase 3: Multiplayer Integration

---

### 🎯 Objective

Expand the game from single-player to multiplayer. Begin with local multiplayer functionality (same screen, shared keyboard) and set the foundation for online multiplayer using Socket.io.

---

### ✅ Section 3.1 — Local Multiplayer (Shared Keyboard)

#### Tasks Completed:
- Added a second player to the scene
- Player 1 uses WASD for movement
- Player 2 uses Arrow Keys
- Both players have gravity, bounce, and collision with ground and ball
- Players are visually distinguishable by color

#### AI Prompt:
```text
We are now doing Section 3.1 of Phase 3: Local multiplayer (2 players on same device and screen)...
```

---

### ⏸ Section 3.2 — Online Multiplayer Ball Sync

#### Status:
- **Postponed** for later phases
- Local multiplayer is currently the primary playable mode
- Socket.io foundation is working and ready to build on when needed

#### Reason:
Focus shifted to polishing local mechanics and core features before implementing complex real-time sync logic.

---

### ✅ Section 3.3 — Multiplayer Score & Win Logic

#### Tasks Completed:
- Scoring logic supports both Player 1 and Player 2
- Correct goal zones tied to correct players
- Win condition triggers when one player reaches 3 goals
- Timer-based win condition and tie logic also works
- Displays outcome clearly (Player 1 Wins, Player 2 Wins, or Tie)

---

### 🔧 Additional Tuning

#### Tasks:
- Fixed collision bug where the ball would reflect backward off the top corner of a player and cause "own-goals"
- Improved physics bounce behavior to ensure the ball deflects in the correct direction
- Screen shake and jumpiness removed from earlier kick interactions

---

### 🧠 Notes & Learnings

- Local multiplayer provides immediate gameplay value without network complexity
- Player collision detection adds strategic depth to gameplay
- Physics tuning is crucial for fair and predictable ball behavior
- Visual feedback systems (color coding, UI updates) enhance player experience

*End of Day 3 Log* 

## 📅 Day 4 — Phase 4: Chaos Event System Implementation

---

### 🎯 Objective

Transform the basic soccer game into "Headshot" by implementing a comprehensive chaos event system that adds unpredictability and excitement to matches. Create 7 different chaos events that trigger randomly during gameplay.

---

### ✅ Section 4.1 — Core Chaos Manager Architecture

#### Tasks Completed:
- Built a centralized `chaosManager` object to control all chaos events
- Implemented event timing system (6-8 second intervals, 8-12 second durations)
- Added event scheduling with no stacking prevention
- Created visual event banners with color-coded names
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Implemented proper cleanup and restoration mechanisms

#### Design Decisions:
- **Random timing**: Events trigger every 6-8 seconds to keep gameplay intense
- **No stacking**: Only one chaos event can be active at a time
- **Visual feedback**: Color-coded banners show players what's happening
- **Graceful cleanup**: All events properly restore original game state

---

### ✅ Section 4.2 — The 7 Chaos Events

#### 🌀 Zero Gravity
- **Effect**: Reduced fall speed and gravity for floaty movement
- **Implementation**: Anti-gravity acceleration applied to players and ball
- **Mechanics**: Slower horizontal movement (0.7x), higher jumps (1.5x)
- **Visual**: Players and ball float more slowly

#### 🔄 Flip Screen
- **Effect**: 180-degree camera rotation with UI protection
- **Implementation**: Camera rotation while keeping UI elements stable
- **Mechanics**: Maintains gameplay while disorienting players
- **Visual**: Entire game world appears upside down

#### ⚡ Speed Boost
- **Effect**: 1.5x movement speed for all players
- **Implementation**: Dynamic speed calculation in update loop
- **Mechanics**: Faster-paced gameplay and ball interactions
- **Visual**: Players move noticeably faster

#### ☄️ Meteor Drop
- **Effect**: Meteors fall from the sky with knockback and stun
- **Implementation**: Spawning system with physics-based meteors
- **Mechanics**: Meteors knock players back and stun for 1.5 seconds
- **Visual**: Orange meteors with collision effects and orange stun tint

#### ⚽ Ball Clone
- **Effect**: Second green-tinted ball with full physics
- **Implementation**: Duplicate ball with all collision detection
- **Mechanics**: Both balls can score goals, doubles the chaos
- **Visual**: Green-tinted cloned ball distinguishable from original

#### 🧠 Big Head Mode
- **Effect**: Players scale up to 1.5x size
- **Implementation**: Sprite scaling with proper restoration
- **Mechanics**: Larger hitboxes affect gameplay dynamics
- **Visual**: Noticeably larger character sprites

#### 🌑 Darkroom
- **Effect**: Screen darkens with spotlight circles following players/ball
- **Implementation**: Dark overlay with dynamic light circles
- **Mechanics**: Limited visibility adds strategic element
- **Visual**: 85% dark overlay with moving light spots

---

### ✅ Section 4.3 — Timer Management & Bug Fixes

#### Original Issues:
- **Meteor Shower Freezing**: Game would randomly freeze on 2nd meteor shower activation
- **Timer Conflicts**: Multiple meteor spawn timers running simultaneously
- **Incomplete Cleanup**: Some events weren't properly cleaning up resources

#### Solutions Implemented:
- **Timer Cleanup**: Added proper timer removal before creating new ones
- **Resource Management**: Comprehensive cleanup in `endMeteorDropEvent()`
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks and defensive programming
- **Stun Functionality**: Added 1.5-second stun effect to meteor hits

#### AI Collaboration:
```text
i was playing a game with my friend, when the meteor shower comes the 2nd time around the game randomly froze maybe its a small problem nothing crazy. also can you change the meteor shower to stun you if any of it hits you
```

---

### ✅ Section 4.4 — Integration & Testing

#### Game Flow Integration:
- **Manual Testing**: Added T-key trigger for chaos events during development
