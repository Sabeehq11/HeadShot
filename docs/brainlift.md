# 🧠 Brainlift Log – SuperHead Showdown

## 📅 Day 1 — Phase 1: Project Setup & Multiplayer Foundation

---

### 🎯 Objective

Set up the full development environment for the game, including:
- Phaser 3 frontend
- Node.js + Socket.io server
- Connecting both sides via real-time sockets

---

### ✅ Accomplished

#### 🖥️ Frontend Setup
- Created `/client` folder with:
  - `index.html` (Phaser canvas)
  - `style.css` (basic UI styling)
  - `game.js` (Phaser game logic)
- Implemented:
  - 800x600 canvas
  - Gravity + physics-based player movement
  - Arrow key / WASD controls
  - FPS counter
  - Visual styling (dark blue background, green square player)
  - Socket connection status + player ID rendering

#### 🛠 Backend Setup
- Created `/server` folder with:
  - `server.js` (Express + Socket.io)
  - `package.json`
- Configured:
  - Socket.io connection logging
  - Ping route (`/ping`) for health check
  - JSON response for server status

#### 🌐 Client-Server Connection
- Client connects to `localhost:3000`
- Sends `"hello from client"` and receives `"hello from server"`
- Verified connection with:
  - Console logs
  - On-screen socket ID + success messages
- Tested in multiple browser tabs to confirm unique player sockets

### 🧩 Challenges & AI Assistance

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Understanding why the game wasn't loading at localhost:3000 | Realized that was the backend server; frontend is served separately |
| Connecting Socket.io client-side with the correct library | Used Cursor to guide setup with CDN and confirm connection logic |
| Managing folder structure cleanly | AI prompt clarified desired structure for `/client` and `/server` |

---

### 🔧 Technical Decisions

#### Frontend Framework Choice
- **Decision**: Phaser 3 with vanilla JavaScript
- **Reasoning**: Lightweight, well-documented, perfect for 2D games
- **AI Input**: Helped structure the game loop and physics setup

#### Backend Architecture
- **Decision**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io
- **Reasoning**: Real-time multiplayer requires WebSocket connections
- **AI Input**: Guided proper Socket.io event handling and player management

#### Development Setup
- **Decision**: Separate client/server folders with independent serving
- **Reasoning**: Clean separation of concerns, easier deployment later
- **AI Input**: Clarified the difference between serving static files vs API endpoints

---

### 🎮 Current Game State

**What Works:**
- ✅ Basic Phaser 3 game with player movement
- ✅ Real-time Socket.io connection
- ✅ Visual connection status indicators
- ✅ Multiple player support (unique IDs)

**What's Next (Phase 2):**
- 🔄 Synchronize player positions across clients
- 🔄 Add soccer ball physics
- 🔄 Implement goal detection
- 🔄 Add basic match mechanics

---

### 📊 Learning Metrics

**Time Spent**: ~2 hours  
**AI Prompts Used**: 3 major prompts + clarifications  
**Technologies Learned**: 
- Phaser 3 game initialization
- Socket.io client-server communication
- Real-time event handling

**Key Takeaways**:
1. AI excels at boilerplate setup and structure guidance
2. Testing connections early prevents later debugging headaches
3. Visual feedback (connection status) helps verify functionality

---

### 🚀 Next Session Goals

1. **Phase 2 Start**: Implement basic multiplayer gameplay
2. **Player Sync**: Share player positions between clients
3. **Game Objects**: Add soccer ball and goal posts
4. **Match Logic**: Basic scoring system

## 📅 Day 2 — Phase 2: Core Game Loop (Single Player)

---

### 🎯 Objective

Build the foundational soccer gameplay loop using Phaser 3:
- Ball physics and interactions
- Goal scoring logic
- Scoreboard and win condition
- Match timer

---

### ✅ Section 2.1 — Ball Mechanics

#### Tasks Completed:
- Added soccer ball to the scene with:
  - Gravity enabled
  - Bounce and collision with player and world bounds
- Ball spawns at center of screen
- Placeholder sprite used for now

#### AI Prompt:
```text
Let's begin Phase 2: Core Game Loop (Single Player). Start with Section 2.1...
```

---

### ✅ Section 2.2 — Goals, Score, Win Condition

#### Tasks Completed:
- Created invisible left/right goal zones
- Ball resets and score increases on overlap
- Score displayed at top of screen using Phaser text
- Win condition: First to 3 goals
- Game ends and displays win message
- Ball and player movement freeze

#### AI Prompt:
```text
Let's continue Phase 2 and move to Section 2.2: Goals, Score, and Win Condition...
```

---

### ✅ Section 2.3 — Match Timer

#### Tasks Completed:
- 60-second countdown timer added
- Timer updates every second
- Game ends if timer reaches 0 before goal limit
- Displays "Time's Up!" message
- All movement and game activity stop on match end

#### AI Prompt:
```text
Let's complete Phase 2 with Section 2.3: Add a match timer...
```

---

### 🧠 Notes & Learnings

- Using `this.time.addEvent()` was effective for countdown loops
- Handling both time-based and score-based game endings requires clear conditional logic
- Phaser's overlap is useful for goal detection zones
- Placeholder assets keep dev fast — we'll add visuals later

---

## 📅 Day 3 — Phase 3: Multiplayer Integration

---

### 🎯 Objective

Expand the game from single-player to multiplayer. Begin with local multiplayer functionality (same screen, shared keyboard) and set the foundation for online multiplayer using Socket.io.

---

### ✅ Section 3.1 — Local Multiplayer (Shared Keyboard)

#### Tasks Completed:
- Added a second player to the scene
- Player 1 uses WASD for movement
- Player 2 uses Arrow Keys
- Both players have gravity, bounce, and collision with ground and ball
- Players are visually distinguishable by color

#### AI Prompt:
```text
We are now doing Section 3.1 of Phase 3: Local multiplayer (2 players on same device and screen)...
```

---

### ⏸ Section 3.2 — Online Multiplayer Ball Sync

#### Status:
- **Postponed** for later phases
- Local multiplayer is currently the primary playable mode
- Socket.io foundation is working and ready to build on when needed

#### Reason:
Focus shifted to polishing local mechanics and core features before implementing complex real-time sync logic.

---

### ✅ Section 3.3 — Multiplayer Score & Win Logic

#### Tasks Completed:
- Scoring logic supports both Player 1 and Player 2
- Correct goal zones tied to correct players
- Win condition triggers when one player reaches 3 goals
- Timer-based win condition and tie logic also works
- Displays outcome clearly (Player 1 Wins, Player 2 Wins, or Tie)

---

### 🔧 Additional Tuning

#### Tasks:
- Fixed collision bug where the ball would reflect backward off the top corner of a player and cause "own-goals"
- Improved physics bounce behavior to ensure the ball deflects in the correct direction
- Screen shake and jumpiness removed from earlier kick interactions

---

### 🧠 Notes & Learnings

- Local multiplayer provides immediate gameplay value without network complexity
- Player collision detection adds strategic depth to gameplay
- Physics tuning is crucial for fair and predictable ball behavior
- Visual feedback systems (color coding, UI updates) enhance player experience
